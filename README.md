Project: Savings Account Menu
Last date edited: 7/11/2024

The program will display a simple savings account menu.
The user will enter their account name, account balance, 
annual interest rate, and deposit amount. The menu will 
then display a number of options for the user. They can 
display the total balance after deposit, calculate the 
monthly interest rate, print the account information, 
and exit the program.
